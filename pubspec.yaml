  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
